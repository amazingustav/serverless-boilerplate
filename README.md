   2. `serverlessBoilerplate` to your `<newServiceName>`;
   3. `myFunction` to your `<newFunctionName>`.
4. Replace folder `myFunction` to your `<newFunctionName>`.

## 🙏 Contribute

First, make sure you have installed [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (Node 16.17.0 or later) and the classic [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/) dependency.

Clone the project, then install the dependencies:

## 🚀 Workflow via Github Actions

When you open a PR:

- `quality.yml` runs linter, tests and typecheck;

When you merge a PR:

- `staging.yml` deploys the serverless-boilerplate stack to staging;
- `production.yml` deploys the serverless-boilerplate stack to production;

## 🧪 Automated Testing

After every commit, git hooks are executed with [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/) and the automated test suite is run with [Jest](https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started).

Prefer following Test Driven Development when creating new features to keep our code quality high. Remember that TDD is not about testing, is about design.

## 🎯 Project features

### Project structure

### 3rd party libraries

- [json-schema-to-ts](https://github.com/ThomasAribart/json-schema-to-ts) - uses JSON-Schema definitions used by API Gateway for HTTP request validation to statically generate TypeScript types in your lambda's handler code base
- [middy](https://github.com/middyjs/middy) - middleware engine for Node.js lambda. This template uses [http-json-body-parser](https://github.com/middyjs/middy/tree/master/packages/http-json-body-parser) to convert API Gateway `event.body` property, originally passed as a stringified JSON, to its corresponding parsed object
- [@serverless/typescript](https://github.com/serverless/typescript) - provides up-to-date TypeScript definitions for your `serverless.ts` service file
- [serverless-prune-plugin](https://github.com/claygregory/serverless-prune-plugin) - prunes old lambda versions.
- [serverless-plugin-aws-alerts](https://github.com/ACloudGuru/serverless-plugin-aws-alerts) - creates alerts automatically in CloudWatch.
- [serverless-plugin-canary-deployments](https://github.com/davidgf/serverless-plugin-canary-deployments) - implement canary deployments of Lambda functions with AWS CodeDeploy.
